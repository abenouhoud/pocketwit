*Updated 4th Sep 2010 14:52: TwitPic and Posterous support now working*

As of 31st August 2010, version 0.77 of PockeTwit stopped working when Twitter changed the way they handle user logins. The development build supports the new method, "OAuth", but is not yet complete.

Please see the notes below if you are happy to run this version.

*Things to note:* You may have to re-activate or re-add your accounts in PockeTwit. Go to Settings | Accounts, then either select each of your Twitter accounts in turn and press "Edit Selected", or "Add New".

Select the link "Verify with Twitter" and a web browser will open in a few seconds. You can use this to approve PockeTwit. *Make sure you are signed in as the correct Twitter account*. Once done you will be given a pin code to enter. Enter this in the "Pin" box in PockeTwit and select "Accept". When you have completed this for all of your accounts, select Accept again on the list of accounts, and it should start working.

*During the verification process PockeTwit might seem to vanish - it is still running, just launch it again and you should go back to it*

Sorry for the nastiness of this, but it seemed better to get something out to you now, rather than wait a few days until it is all working. 

*Known problems:*
- You might get "Communication Error" coming up if there are no new tweets since the last update. Please ignore it.
- Picture uploading is currently limited to TwitPic and Posterous.

= Introduction =

This is a link to the latest unstable development testing build.  I use it to test out code before I feel it's ready for release to general users.  It usually runs ok, but is much more likely to have bugs or crash than a "release" version.

Installing it will not overwrite or affect an installed "release" build.  It creates its own separate folder and shortcut.

There is no upgrade checker built into the dev build.  However you can always get the latest build by going to the "About" page and choosing "Upgrade".
