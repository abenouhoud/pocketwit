#summary Download the latest unstable development build.

= Introduction =

This is a link to the latest unstable development testing build.  I use it to test out code before I feel it's ready for release to general users.  It usually runs ok, but is much more likely to have bugs or crash than a "release" version.

Installing it will not overwrite or affect an installed "release" build.  It creates its own separate folder and shortcut.
