*This is not a Beta. This is pre-Beta. We are running it on our phones, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. Please bear with us while we get it all working correctly. *

*The installer will automatically download the .NET Compact Framework if you need it.*

As of 31st August 2010, version 0.77 of PockeTwit stopped working when Twitter changed the way they handle user logins. We released v0.82, then v0.82a, with support for OAuth and have been working to resolve problems in those releases. v0.83 has been used successfully by thousands of people and this development build includes part of the additional changes we aim to add for v0.84.

The development build includes a number of changes:
- fixes to some common crashes
- the first step in the transition to [http://pocketwit.posterous.com/a-better-experience the new style of uploading].

Please see the notes below if you are happy to run this version.

*Limitations/potential problems/needs testing:*
- Much of the code behind attachment uploading has been rewritten & extended, so is in need of testing
- Uploading of videos is limited to YFrog, Moby and Posterous
- Uploading of audio is limited to Moby and Posterous
- Uploading of documents is limited to Posterous
- Later versions will allow selection of different services to provide full coverage, while using your favourite photo uploader
- The caption title of the uploaded media will be set to whatever is in the current contents of the update box. Later versions will allow this to be changed.

Note that if you use [http://www.mobypicture.com/ Moby] or [http://posterous.com/ Posterous], you can configure your account to automatically upload to Flickr, YouTube and blogs whenever you upload an attachment.

= Introduction =

This is a link to the latest unstable development testing build.  I use it to test out code before I feel it's ready for release to general users.  It usually runs ok, but is much more likely to have bugs or crash than a "release" version.

Installing it will not overwrite or affect an installed "release" build.  It creates its own separate folder and shortcut.

There is no upgrade checker built into the dev build.  However you can always get the latest build by going to the "About" page and choosing "Upgrade".
