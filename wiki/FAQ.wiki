  *  *It crashed!  What do I do?*
Crashes generate an "error.txt" file in the Program folder.  If you could create an Issue on this site and attach that file, it would go a long way to helping me hunt down the bug.  In the meanwhile, I've found that deleting the (user)FriendsTimeLine.xml file and ArtCache folder from the program folder often helps.

  *  *I can't see the whole tweet*
Sometimes word-wrapping in the tweets causes the last word or two to be cut off from the display.  You can select the clipped tweet and click the center-button in the D-Pad to view the entire message.

  *  *How do I use ping.fm?*
If you have a ping.fm account, they will provide you with a unique "application key* at http://ping.fm/key/.  This key replaces your username and password in applications that connect to ping.fm.

It's VERY long and difficult to enter.  The best way to do so is launch pocket IE to http://ping.fm/key/.  Put the cursor in the middle of the key then tap+hold to bring up the context menu.  Choose "Select All" from the menu, then copy the key.  Then you'll be able to paste it into PockeTwit when needed.
