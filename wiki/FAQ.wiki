  *  *It crashed!  What do I do?*
Crashes generate an "error.txt" file in the Program folder.  If you could create an Issue on this site and attach that file, it would go a long way to helping me hunt down the bug.  In the meanwhile, I've found that deleting the (user)FriendsTimeLine.xml file and ArtCache folder from the program folder often helps.

  *  *I can't see the whole tweet*
Sometimes word-wrapping in the tweets causes the last word or two to be cut off from the display.  You can select the clipped tweet and click the center-button in the D-Pad to view the entire message.

*Note:*  [http://code.google.com/p/pocketwit/issues/detail?id=34 There's a current bug] that causes it to sometimes miss this option.  I hope to fix it shortly.
