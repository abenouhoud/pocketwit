I believe that with every application eventually someone wants skins.  I haven't put in a full-blown skinning engine, but you can easily change the color set for the application

If you want to customize the colors, look for the "colors.txt" file in the program folder.  It contains a list of element styles and the R:G:B values for their color.  Modify those values and restart PockeTwit to see the results.

If you've come up with something nice, let me know!  If enough people want, I can look into extending the customization capabilities in future releases.
